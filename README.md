### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm RamÃ³n Elias and I love coding, designing software applying  best practices and tools. I do care about how to build scalable solutions (SOLID, CQRS, Clean Code Architecture, Patterns.). 
### Jobies
When I have some free time use to read tech books, draw and learn about new frameworks and tools. Cats are my favorite way to let stress behind, I cant resist being close to a cat and hold him tight. :)
